#Things I learned in Week 8

On the Monday of week 8, we learned how does the N Queen problem work. I understood that using backtracking would be a good solution for this problem. On Wednesday of this week, we listened two different resentations about C, C++ and Lua, which are inspiring.




#Presentation Reflection #1

C/C++ and C#
Serita & YZ

##Three things I learned from this presentation
1. C++ was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup while he was working for AT&T Bell Labs in the early 1908.

1. C# was designed by Anders Hejisberg . C-like Object oriented language.

1. C# is designed from C++ and C language, but not a clone of Java.


##Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest.
no

##Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation, timing, humor, etc)

Mnay details. Good content.
The comparison between all those languages are great for understanding.

#Presentation Reflection #2

LUA
Nick and Sean

##Three things I learned from this presentation
1. Lua is a multi-paradigm language designed for embedded use in applications. And the interpreter is written in ANSIC.
1. Originally Lua had 7 tyepes: Numbers-only real numbers, Strings, Tables, Nil, Userdata, Lua functions, C functions. And C API was included for easy expanding on the Lua language.
1. The pros of Lua are its readability, writability, and realiability. The cons of Lua are Niether variables nor functions have declared and semicolons not needed between expressions which may lead to some problem when writing.

##Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation, timing, humor, etc)
