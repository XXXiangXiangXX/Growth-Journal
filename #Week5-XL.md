#Things I learned in Week 5

In week 5, we learned more about how does programming language work. We used C as an example to learn how compile, link and load work. It contains a process that turns .c file into compiler and return a .o file and this machine code goes through the low level virtual machine and generates a single file of executable instruction. And finally, loading to the memory. The entire compilation to execution process make me understand the programing languages much better. Moreover, we discussed how does compilation process work. This process of lexical analysis to parsing to the code generation is very inspiring and it just make me adore all the intelligence of all those programmers who created this.

After learning compilation to execution process, we learned more about imperative paradigm and state. This process of learning helped us with Jay interpreter. 

In assignments, I learned many about how to describe a programming language. Using BNF and extended BNF to describe a programming language is a very good way. I also understand how the parse tree works. Other than that, in week 5, we started to get familiar with Jat interpreter and how the values and states work.
