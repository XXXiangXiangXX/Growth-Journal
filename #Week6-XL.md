#Things I learned in Week 6

In week 6, We started the Jay interpreter project. We talked more about the data types and the characteristics of the common primitive data types. The most impressive thing I have learned about are details of structured data types such as different arrays, tuples, and lists. All these knowledge are important for later learning and understanding. It helps with implementing data types in our jay interpreter.

On Friday, we talked about dangling pointers, memory leaks and garbage collection, which are some different features on different programming languages. The concept about memory leaks and garbage collection was reinforced through Alyce's talking. I understood more about the why memory leak would happen and how some languages like Java could avoid this situation. Moreover, we talked about else ambiguity. Some languages must have an 'else' following 'if' statement but in some languages there is no such a requirement, which would cause some ambiguity. Fortunately, most languages have their own ways to solve this problem.

#Presentation Reflection #1

Prolog
Alex, Daniel, and Elan


##Three things I learned from this presentation
1. Prolog is a language that is different from many other languages. It consists of there different components. They are facts of the relations involved, rules concerning relations, and queries.
1. Facts contain the properties of objects or relationship between objects. And once we have a database of facts, we can use queries to ask questions.
1. The weakness of this language are that the input and output is not always easy and some features haven't been standardized and differ between implementations.

##Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest.

no

##Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation, timing, humor, etc)

Clarity is strong and I really like the code example they provided which makes the presentation more clear.
