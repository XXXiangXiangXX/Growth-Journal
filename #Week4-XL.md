#Things I learned in Week 4

In week 4, there were many information that are interesting and reinforced my understanding about the functinoal languages. As we learned Scheme and Haskell in previous two weeks, I gradually gained more knowledges about this type of language. After installed Jupyter for both Haskell and Scheme, I implemented homework assignments. The learning process largely enriched my ability to learn a new language from scratch. Haskell and Scheme are great languages to play with because switching from imperative to functional language is a interesting process for a programmer. It helps with understanding more about the computer science.

On Friday of week 4, we learned more things about semantics and syntax. Those are very different. The example of 'colorless green odeas sleep furiously' was impressive, which tells us the difference between syntax and semantics.

#Presentation Reflection #1

COBOL
by Hazel & Nora & Octavia

##Three things I learned from this presentation

- COBOL stands for common business-oriented language. It is a English-liked programming language. It is designed for business use. COBOL is imperative procedural and object-oriented later. 

- One of the features of COBOL is that it uses English as the actual programming language. It provides the possibility for people who does not have much programming background to understand the code. COBOL also allows long variable length. 

- The readability of this language is strong and it can handle huge processing volumes.

##Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest.
No

##Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation, timing, humor, etc)

They have provided many information and it helps with understanding the COBOL




#Presentation Reflection #2

ALGO Programiming Language
by Daniel and Preston

##Three things I learned from this presentation

- ALGO has three different versions: 58, 60, and 68. 

- ALGO has features include statically typed, procedural, concurrent, numerous built in datatypes, procedures, operators, loops.

- Language oddities: Five different null types, Call by name


##Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest.
No

##Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation, timing, humor, etc)

Daniel and Preston explained many things about ALGO clearly. They also answered many questions with sort of preperation.

#Presentation Reflection #3

APL - A Programiming Language
by Sam

##Three things I learned from this presentation

- APL has multidimensional arrays and it uses dynamic memories. APL uses recursion to go through iterations. And it does not use datatypes.

- APL uses functions and it can take other functions which will be evaluated. 

- APL has many powerful functions and it uses symbols that make the language extremelt expressive.




##Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest.
No

##Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation, timing, humor, etc)

The core features of the language explained clearly.
