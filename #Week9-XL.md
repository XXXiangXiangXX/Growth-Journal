#Things I learned in Week 9

In Week 9 I went back to China but after looked at notes that Zach gave me, I got some impression with two languages, they are Scala and Ruby.
On Friday, We discussed BNF grammars of Jay language and C. The comparison between these two languages are interesting. When we talked about the associativity and looked at the way of different operator works, I gain many.

Scala

##Three things I learned from this presentation
