#Things I learned in Week 7

In week 7, we digged in to learn more about data types, expressions, and assignment statements. By solving a problem of proving the correctness of a program, we learned about how to prove by using invariant and some key factors of priving a program. We also udnerstood the difference between Pass-by-value, Pass-by-reference, and Pass-by-value-result. 



#Presentation Reflection #1

Smalltalk
Torey, Emilio

##Three things I learned from this presentation
1. Smalltalk is a programming language that was originally designed for educational purpose. It is an object oriented programming language. The preceding languages are Simula, Clu, and etc.
1. Smalltalk is an untyped language and the parameter passing is done by reference except for immediate object. Also, the language uses dynamic binding.
1. I also learned about the implementation and fundamental concepts of the smalltalk. Moreover, Smalltalk has some advantages such as it makes you a better Java programmer by understanding its object-oriented concepts from another perspective. And the simplicity of the language and tools allows you to focus yourenergies on learning programming techniques, not on language formalities.

##Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest.
no

##Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation, timing, humor, etc)

Mnay details. Good content.


#Presentation Reflection #2

R
Bart

##Three things I learned from this presentation
1. The history of R determined the functionality and main purpose of this programming language. It became a more general purpose language and it is designed mainly for data analysis. The language is influenced by S, Scheme. And it influenced Julia.
1. R is an object oriented language. There are many features of this programming language. First, the basic data type in R is the vector and it functions as first-class object. Also, R uses lazy evaluation. parameters are dynamically typed and are dynamically evaluated.
1. R has many strengths such as there are many packages that allow for extension and customization. It provides high-quality graphics. And it also integrates with other languages well. It is very friendly to statisticians and it is open-source.
